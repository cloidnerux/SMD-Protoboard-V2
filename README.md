# SMD-Protoboard-V2
SMD Prototyping board version 2

SMD prototyping board for making that quick prototype.
Designed to fit in the 5cm^2 limit of the cheapest elecrow offer
Designed with Altium Designer, the used gerbers for ordering are in the "Protoboard.zip"

This design is based upon my [last design](https://github.com/cloidnerux/SMD-ProtoBoard), but incorporates my experiences with the last design. I ditched the smaller pads, as they are not usable and increased the actuall usable space. Further, there are now holw spaced 2mm and 1.5mm apart, such that more things can be build with it, like adapter boards for small connectors or Debug probes using smaller pitch. Also a "ZIF" connector row is added, to be able to build a flat-flex adapter board as I had this very use case. Also there is a third of the bottom side equipped with 4 power rails, such that a simple design can be implemented much more easily.
